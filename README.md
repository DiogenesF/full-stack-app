This is the repo for the full application, you will have to cd into both the backend and frontend folders

Once there, you'll see in their respective READMEs the instructions to run this app locally

### Obs:

There are a couple of improvements that could have been done in this code, like:
Unit tests
Loading states
Better error treatment
Addition of types, etc

to keep it simpler I decided not to add them
